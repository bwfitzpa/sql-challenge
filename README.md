# sql-challenge
All materials for the challenge are in the EmployeeSQL folder.
The data folder in the EmployeeSQL folder has all of the CSV files for the challenge.

Date Modeling: employees_ERD.PNG has the entity relationship diagram of the tables, this diagram was created using QuickDBD.

Data Engineering: table_schemata.sql is used to create the tables that the CSV files are then uploaded into to then be able to do the analysis. Each table name is the same as the CSV it corresponds to.

Data Analysis: queries.sql is used to run each of the eight queries in the assignment, the code for each query is labeled with the instructions for that query.
